## ⚠️ Issue Found

### Vercel Deployment Problem
The live site at `https://agri-lms.vercel.app` is showing an **OLD VERSION** with:
- Clerk authentication ("Sign in to AgriLearn")
- Different UI than current codebase

**Possible Causes:**
1. Vercel is connected to a different repository
2. Vercel is connected to a different branch
3. There's caching on Vercel

**Required Action:**
The user needs to verify/reconfigure the Vercel deployment:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find the `agri-lms` project
3. Check **Settings > Git** to confirm it's connected to:
   - Repository: `https://github.com/muzabasha/agri-lms`
   - Branch: `main`
4. If correct, trigger a manual redeploy:
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
5. If still showing old version, delete the project and reimport
